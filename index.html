    <br>

    <p>     I am Josh Jenkins. I was born and raised in St. Louis and went to Francis Howell
        High School in Weldon Spring. After graduation, I went on to study Chemistry at the 
        University of Missouri-Kansas City. Post-graduation, I have now found myself working
        in Commercial Real Estate.
    </p>

    <p>     Hobbies of mine include running and cycling. I enjoy hiking and fishing and pretty much
        anything outdoors. I watch sports and read in my down time. I have a mother and father 
        that both live in St. Louis, a twin brother who is also here, and a younger brother that
        now lives in Connecticut for work. Music is also a big passion of mine.
